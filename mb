## Overview

A Python implementation for simulating 3-qubit quantum circuits, demonstrating quantum gates, superposition, and entanglement. This project is structured to showcase professional coding practices and portfolio-quality work.

---

## Features

- 3-qubit quantum state simulation  
- Support for common quantum gates (Hadamard, CNOT, Pauli gates)  
- Interactive visualization capabilities  
- Measurement probability calculations  
- Extensible framework for quantum circuit experiments  

---

## Portfolio Highlights

This repository demonstrates a fully structured Python project implementing a three-qubit quantum system. The project follows professional development standards:

- **Organized source code** in `src/` with clear module structure.  
- **Unit tests** included in `tests/` to ensure correctness and maintainability.  
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** configured via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/python-ci.yml`) to automatically run tests on every commit.  
- **Version control best practices** using Git branches and SSH authentication for secure, professional workflow.  
- **Dependencies and project configuration** managed with `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`.  

This setup illustrates an end-to-end professional workflow, demonstrating skills in **Python development, testing, CI/CD, and Git/GitHub workflows**, making it an ideal example for a coding portfolio.
